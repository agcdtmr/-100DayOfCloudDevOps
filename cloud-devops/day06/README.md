1. **Hello World Script:**
   Write a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal when executed.

2. **User Input Script:**
   Create a script that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting message using that name.

3. **File Existence Check:**
   Write a script that checks if a specified file exists in the current directory. If it does, print a message saying "File exists"; otherwise, print "File does not exist".

4. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   Develop a script that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.

5. **Directory Listing:**
   Create a script that lists all files and directories in the current directory.

6. **Simple Conditional Script:**
   Write a script that takes a number as input from the user and prints whether it's even or odd.

7. **Environment Information Script:**
   Develop a script that prints out basic information about the system environment, such as the current user, hostname, and operating system.

8. **String Manipulation:**
   Create a script that takes a string as input from the user and prints its length.

9. **Backup Script:**
   Write a script that copies a specified file to a backup directory.

10. **Password Generator:**
    Develop a script that generates a random password of a specified length and complexity level (e.g., including numbers, special characters).

These tasks focus on essential concepts in shell scripting while keeping the complexity level low for beginners. They cover basic input/output operations, conditionals, file manipulation, and system interaction.

Hi everyone! I'm at the beginning of my tech career.

Join me as I share my journeyâ€”highlighting progress, making errors, be bff with the bugs, read code like it is a novel, linking helpful resources and improvements into writing documentation.

I'm here to ask plenty of questions, question a lot of concepts and encourage a diverse perspective, all while infusing a touch of humor into the tech world.

Can't wait to learn from you, hear your feedback and engage in discussions with fellow enthusiasts.
