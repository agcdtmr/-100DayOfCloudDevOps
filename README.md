# 100 Days Of Cloud DevOps Challenge

This repository represents my Cloud DevOps Challenge, aimed at enhancing my skills and proficiency in this career trajectory. It serves as the foundation for sharing ideas, fostering growth, and reaching new milestones in Cloud DevOps! I began this process on March 18, 2024 (Monday), and plan to continue until September 2024. I will be dedicating one hour each day, excluding weekends and holidays, to gaining a foundational understanding of the various aspects of Cloud DevOps.


I'll combine the learning techniques I grasp from my University Degree, [#100Devs](https://100devs.org/), Techgrounds, [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com), Codam Amsterdam, DataTalks.Club, Code First Girls, [TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/c/techworldwithnana), [John Savill's Technical Training](https://www.youtube.com/@NTFAQGuy), Shubham Londhe's [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps), Michael Cade's [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps/tree/main/2022/Days), [Cloud Engineer Roadmap](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cloud-engineer-roadmap-geeks-of-gurukul/), [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops), [Cloud DevOps Engineer Roadmap](https://github.com/agcdtmr/100DaysOfCloudDevOps/blob/main/Cloud%20DevOps%20Engineer%20Roadmap/README.md) and other helpful resources and community out there!
